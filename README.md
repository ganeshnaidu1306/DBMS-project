# DBMS-project

This is our DBMS project for calculating fare from one city to another.
The user has to select two city names: first city, where he is travelling from, and second city where he is travelling to.
The application calculates the fare price and lists all thedriver details that are available.
Then the user has to select a driver name from a drop-down list and start the ride.
After the ride is completed, then user has to rate the ride experience from 5 stars to 1 star, 5 being the highest rating.

BACK-END:
We used SQLServer to create the back-end database, where we store all the details of drivers, customers, and everything else.

FRONT-END:
We used C# to code the front-end application using VISUAL STUDIO.
